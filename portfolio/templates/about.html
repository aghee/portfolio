                    Hi there!
                    I am Agnes, a Business Intelligence Analyst with skills in web application development using Django.
                    In my previous role as a Business Analyst for customer support over the past three years, I excelled
                    at translating business needs into actionable technical requirements. I effectively managed client
                    expectations through timely communication, trained users on new systems to ensure user adoption, and
                    facilitated the smooth deployment of updates to production.
                    While my experience in customer support provided valuable skills, I developed a strong interest in
                    data analysis. This led me to focus on analyzing data according to specified requirements and
                    deriving actionable insights for management. Over the last few months, I have honed my skills in
                    data analysis using Python, SQL, and Tableau to achieve this goal.
                    I am confident that my combined expertise in business analysis, data analysis, and Django
                    development positions me to quickly learn, adapt, and contribute valuable insights to your projects.
                    I am eager to discuss how my skills and experience align with your team's needs and how I can add
                    value to your organization.
                    <br> <br>
