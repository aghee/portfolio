                    Hi there! I am Agnes, a junior Django developer with a strong foundation in business analysis. In my previous role as a Business Analyst for customer support (3 years), I excelled at translating
                    business needs into actionable technical requirements. I effectively managed client expectations through timely communication,trained users on new systems ensuring user adoption, and ensured smooth
                    deployment of updates to production. This experience instilled a passion for building the solutions I helped define, leading me to pursue web development full-time. I am confident my combined skills
                    in business analysis and Django development will allow me to quickly learn, adapt, and contribute valuable insights to your projects. I am eager to discuss how my skills and experience align with
                    your team's needs. <br> <br>
                    My Mantra: <b>"Connecting the dots backward most times will make sense."</b>
